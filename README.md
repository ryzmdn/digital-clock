# Digital Clock

The Digital Clock is a web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays real-time dynamic information such as the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds), AM/PM status, date, month, year, and simulated environmental data like fake temperature and humidity.

## Features

- **Dynamic Time Display**: Shows current hours, minutes, and seconds, updated in real time.
- **AM/PM Indicator**: Displays whether the current time is AM or PM.
- **Date Information**: Provides the current date, month, and year.
- **Fake Temperature and Humidity**: Simulates and displays environmental data for a fun and interactive experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for seamless use across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Visually Appealing Interface**: Styled with CSS to deliver a clean and modern look.

## How It Works

1. **Dynamic Time Updates**: JavaScript fetches and updates the current time every second.
2. **AM/PM Display**: The application determines and displays the appropriate period (AM or PM).
3. **Date and Environment**: The app calculates the current date and displays fake temperature and humidity values, adding an engaging layer of interactivity.
4. **Responsive Styling**: CSS ensures the UI is adaptable to any screen size, offering an optimal viewing experience.
